            <h2>Why Chefchaouen?</h2>
            <h3>Chefchaouen, the blue diamond</h3>
            <p>
              Beautifully perched beneath the raw peaks of the Rif, Chefchaouen
              is one of the prettiest towns in Morocco, an artsy, blue-washed
              mountain village that feels like its own world. While tourism has
              definitely taken hold, the balance between ease and authenticity
              is just right.
            </p>
            <p>
              The old medina is a delight of Moroccan and Andalusian influence
              with red-tiled roofs, bright-blue buildings and narrow lanes
              converging on busy Plaza Uta El Hammam and its restored kasbah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Long known to backpackers for the easy availability of kif
              (cannabis), the town has rapidly gentrified and offers a range of
              quality accommodation, good food, lots to do and no hassles to
              speak of, making it a strong alternative to a hectic multicity
              tour. This is a great place to relax, explore and take day trips
              to the cool green hills.

                  Beautiful place, amazing customer service, great food. The
                  restaurant is tucked away in this cute garden - a perfect
                  oasis from the often busy and bustling square! The place has a
                  cute and welcoming vibe, and so do the servers! The food came
                  out fairly quickly and was really delicious. They have an
                  array of Moroccan and general Middle Eastern / Mediterranean
                  type dishes and the quality of the food is excellent. My
                  friends and I would certainly come back if we had another
                  night here! -

                  Wonderful oasis of peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle
                  outside with a beautiful stylish decor and excellent coffees
                  and teas. Excellent internet service too. We accidentally
                  stumbled into it mid afternoon right. So try as we might we
                  could not get another bite in and can’t comment on the food.
                  But other people seemed enjoying it around us. -

                  A great tiny restaurant in the Medina. It’s in an alleyway,
                  but go look for it, because the experience is worth it. They
                  have a beautiful interior with mosaic tiles and next to that
                  amazing food. We had a Marocan salad and two tajines. It all
                  tasted amazing and all at an affordable price! -
